# augment_dataset 🎨

The `augment_dataset` module is part of the **Balatro** project.
It helps you **expand your labeled card dataset** by generating multiple synthetic variations of each card image.
This allows your AI model to **learn robust representations** even with a small number of original screenshots.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Load labeled images from the dataset (`annotate_dataset`)
* Apply a variety of augmentations:

  * Rotation
  * Cropping / resizing
  * Flipping (horizontal/vertical)
  * Brightness and contrast adjustments
  * Blur and noise
* Save augmented images with the same labeling metadata
* Configurable augmentation parameters for flexibility

---

## 🛠 Installation

Make sure you are inside the Balatro project folder and dependencies are installed:

```bash
cd balatro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

Run the augmentation script:

```bash
python -m augment_dataset.main
```

Or with custom parameters:

```bash
python -m augment_dataset.main --input dataset/labeled --output dataset/augmented --n 30
```

The script will:

1. Load all labeled images from your dataset folder
2. Apply configured augmentations to each image
3. Save the augmented images in a separate folder (or subfolder per card)
4. Maintain the original labels for each augmented image

---

## 📌 Notes

* **Augmentation must be run after labeling** (`annotate_dataset`) to ensure correct card metadata.
* You can configure:

  * Number of variations per image
  * Types of augmentations applied
  * Output folder for augmented images
* Augmentation is optional, but **highly recommended** if you have few images per card
* The augmented images can then be used in `train_model` to improve AI performance
