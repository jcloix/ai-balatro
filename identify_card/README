# identify_card 🔎

The `identify_card` module is part of the **Balatro** project.  
Its purpose is to **use the trained AI model to identify cards in real scenarios**.  
With this module, you can load a trained model, analyze screen captures, and detect which cards are displayed.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Load a trained model from `train_model`
- Detect which card is shown in a given image or screenshot
- Support for polychrome recognition (if trained)
- Provide easy-to-use functions for integration into other scripts
- Can be extended for **real-time screen monitoring**

---

## 🛠 Installation

Make sure you are inside the Balatro project folder and dependencies are installed:

```bash
cd balatro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

Run the module directly:

```bash
python -m identify_card --image path/to/card.png
```

Example Python usage:

```python
from identify_card import identify

card_id, confidence = identify("screenshots/card_001.png")

print(f"Detected card: {card_id} (confidence: {confidence:.2f})")
```

---

## ⚙️ Options

- `--image <path>` → Path to the image/screenshot to analyze  
- `--model <path>` → Path to the trained model (default: `models/card_model.pth`)  
- `--threshold <float>` → Minimum confidence threshold (default: 0.8)  

---

## 🔄 Workflow Context

```text
build_dataset  --->  annotate_dataset  --->  train_model  --->  identify_card
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- Works best if the dataset is well-annotated and trained for polychrome.  
- Can be integrated with `utils` functions for continuous monitoring.  
- Future improvements: real-time screen capture loop, GPU acceleration.
