# train_model 🧠

The `train_model` module is part of the **Balatro** project.  
Its purpose is to **train an AI model to recognize cards** based on the annotated dataset.  
The trained model can later be used for real-time card identification with `identify_card`.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Load annotated dataset created with `annotate_dataset`
- Train a model to recognize cards
- Support for detecting **polychrome variations**
- Save trained models for later inference
- Configurable training parameters (epochs, batch size, etc.)

---

## 🛠 Installation

Make sure you are inside the Balatro project folder and dependencies are installed:

```bash
cd balatro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

Run the module directly:

```bash
python -m train_dataset
```

### Example workflow

1. Prepare your dataset using:
   - `build_dataset` (capture images)
   - `annotate_dataset` (organize & label)

2. Start training:
   ```bash
   python -m train_dataset --epochs 20 --batch-size 32
   ```

3. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

4. Use the trained model with `identify_card` for real-time recognition.

## ⚙️ Options

- `--epochs <int>` → Number of training epochs (default: 10)  
- `--batch-size <int>` → Batch size for training (default: 32)  
- `--output <path>` → Path to save the trained model (default: `models/card_model.pth`)  

---

## 🔄 Workflow Context

```text
build_dataset  --->  annotate_dataset  --->  train_model  --->  identify_card
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- Currently supports basic image classification workflows.  
- Polychrome recognition is experimental and may require dataset extensions.  
- Future versions may support transfer learning or custom model architectures.
